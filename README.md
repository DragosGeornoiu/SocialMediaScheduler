# SocialMediaScheduler
  
  Schedule quotes from Brainyquote (parserdev will not work because I did not provide a parser after going with xml serialization. Also, made scheduler to parse only Brainyquote topics/categories or recieve a xml from the user that respects the structure of the serialized hashtable of quotes).
  Schedule the parsed or provided quotes on whatever social network you have registered in buffer API, but if you are using something else of Twitter, Facebook or Google+Pages that has a maximum number of characters, you should provide that info in class Scheduler, method getMaxCharacters(String), otherwise it will be set to 500...
