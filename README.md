# SocialMediaScheduler
  
  Schedule quotes from Brainyquote (parserdev will not work because I did not provide a parser after going with xml serialization.
Schedule them on whatever social network you have registered in buffer API, but if you are using something else of Twitter, 
Facebook or Google+Pages that has a maximum number of characters, you should provide that info in class Scheduler, method 
getMaxCharacters(String)..
